                <h2>Improving 'Discussions' with Tailored Prompts</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">The purpose of creating this web page is to assist researchers in generating structured and comprehensive prompts for discussing their study results with a chatbot. Often, researchers need to analyze and present their findings in the context of existing scientific literature. This can be a time-consuming and challenging process, especially when aiming to adhere to the formal style and structure required by academic publications. The Custom Prompt Generator web page streamlines this process by allowing researchers to input their results directly or via a file attachment and then generate a detailed prompt for discussing these results. The generated prompt includes references to specified scientific papers, ensuring that the discussion is well-supported and aligns with the standards of scientific discourse.</p>
                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">To use this web page, researchers can follow a few simple steps. First, select the appropriate tab based on how they wish to enter their results. The "Direct Results Entry" tab allows users to manually input their findings, while the "Results File Attachment" tab lets users upload a file containing their results. After entering or uploading the results, researchers need to specify the range of scientific papers they wish to reference in the discussion. This is done by entering the starting and ending values for the paper range. Once this information is provided, the "Generate Prompt" button will become active. Clicking this button generates a prompt tailored to the entered results and specified papers. Researchers can then copy this prompt and use it to engage the chatbot in a detailed discussion of their findings. The "Combining Discussion" tab allows for the integration of multiple discussion versions into one comprehensive prompt, providing a cohesive and thorough analysis of the results. By using this web page, researchers can efficiently create high-quality prompts that facilitate insightful and structured academic discussions.</p>
